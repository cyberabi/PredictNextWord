"""
    Next-word predictor without using ML libraries.
    This algorithm illustrates generative AI basics transparently.
    It doesn't enforce matching of brackets, parenthesis, or quotes.
    It doesn't properly handle abbreviations like Mrs. or Mr.
    It assumes single apostrophes are contractions.
